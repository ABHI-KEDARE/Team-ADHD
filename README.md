#What makes our bot different from others?

The bot has been built with a minimalist mindset. 
Using the necessary mechanical components, we have built the bot to be exceptionally stable. We have used four 200 RPM motors and four wheels of 7 cm diameter and 4 cm width. The heaviest component of the bot, the battery, has been placed on the underside of the chassis, stuck using tape and fastened using wires. We placed the battery a little behind the geometrical center of the chassis, reducing the chances of topple significantly. This helped us to put the center of mass of the bot below the chassis, making it resistant to toppling even on steep slopes and downslopes.

We used minimum soldering and number of wires, which is evident in our circuit design uploaded. The revolutionary idea behind our design was to place the motor driver on the underside of the ESP32, making the circuit needed to be soldered to be very less. We aligned the motor driver to the output pins of ESP32.

For taking care of the obstacles placed on the incline, we stuck a 15 cm scale on the front side of the front wheels, which prevented the obstacles from going under the bot as well as helping to push them to drop into the boxes on the floor. 



#Motivation and XLR8 Journey

The intention and the enthusiasm behind participating in XLR8 was to explore and learn about different aspects of making a vehicle. A bot is the most basic replica of a vehicle. Being mechanical engineering students, we wanted to learn about the mechanical and electrical aspects of making a bot. Participating in the competition gave us an insight into the designing and working of vehicles. We are all motivated to participate in future competitions after XLR8, and want to explore more in this field.

We all began pretty unsure about what to do. The get mechanized and get electrified sessions overwhelmed us. We did not know what to do next. One evening, all the members went to TL to see the mechanical components, and choose their dimensions. As we were trying to design and figure out the Physics of the bot, we understood what concepts were needed to be applied. Keepin in mind the torque, we chose 200 RPM motors. Keepin in mind the friction, we chose 4 cm wide wheels. Keeping in mind the center of mass, we decided to place th ebattery o the underside of the chassis, and a little behind to the center of the geometrical cenetr of bot, making it very stable as a whole for a variety of tracks in the problme statement. Our main goal was to complete succesfully, the staircase, the loose brodge, and the incline with the obstacles. We decided to implement differential mechanicsm in wheels, as the track required sharpp turns in certain places. 

After our mechanical design was pretty ready, we decided to move on to electrical circuit. The leader spent hours and studied the electrical circuit, and designed the basic circuit. One night when we were assembling all the components of the bot and essentially, figuring out the electrical circuit physically in terms of wires and soldering on perforated board, we suddenly came up with the idea to place the motor driver on the underside of the ESP32, which minimized the need to solder significantly. We did have some problems choosing the pins on ESP32, and designiing the circuit on the perforated board, but after soome contemplation, we were able to complete the bot.

We learnt a lot and this competition gave us an amazing experience of teamwork and exploration of something coompletely new to us. We had fun to solder our team name on perforated board.

#Help received from the mentor

The mentor had a vital role in our idealization for the bot. We discussed a lot of possible ideas for the bot. We even discussed the pros and cons of each idea that we had. We explored various designs such as hinged chassis, tank and belt concept, a six wheeled bot with suspension and a five wheeled car with a linear actuator. Then we finally came to the conclusion that simple design is the best. The most important aspect of the car was the center of mass and the wheelbase. Shivam helped us to get the best dimensions for the chassis. It was fun to work with him. He kept a record of our progress and gave the best possible guidance throughout the journey.

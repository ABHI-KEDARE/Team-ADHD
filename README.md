# Team-ADHD We are a team of 4 members

The bot has been built with a minimalist mindset. 
Using the necessary mechanical components, we have built the bot to be exceptionally stable. We have used four 200 RPM motors and four wheels of 7 cm diameter and 4 cm width. The heaviest component of the bot, the battery, has been placed on the underside of the chassis, stuck using tape and fastened using wires. This helped us to put the center of mass of the bot below the chassis, making it resistant to toppling even on steep slopes and downslopes.
We used minimum soldering and number of wires, which is evident in our circuit design uploaded. The revolutionary idea behind our design was to place the motor driver on the underside of the ESP32, making the circuit needed to be soldered to be very less. 
For taking care of the obstacles placed on the incline, we stuck a 15 cm scale on the front side of the front wheels, which prevented the obstacles from going under the bot as well as helping to push them to drop into the boxes on the floor.
